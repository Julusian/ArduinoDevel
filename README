Arduino Developing Base Project

I've started this project in order to be able to easily start develop and test arduino application in eclipse.
You don't need any additional plugin, all you need is ANT and optional "Eclipse for C/C++ Developers" (if you want syntax highlighting).
Also you have full control over the build process and is really easy to flash your device.

DEPENDENCIES
* Linux: 
    - avr: I really suggest to download the avr toolchain from www.atmel.com.
           I've tried to create a correct toolchain with crossdev on Gentoo but any trying was resulting in a non working environment.
           (the toolchain was successfully created but the result hex was simply not working after installed on device, only easy code was) 
           
           Here the link to my working toolchain:

    - avrdude
    
* windows:
    - avr: simply install winavr, it contains all you needs :
           http://winavr.sourceforge.net/
           
           
           
           
HOW TO USE    

There is an example under src/yourproject.
Copy files build.xml and local-sample.properties in your project dir.
Rename local-sample.properties in local.properties and adjust properties values in it.

There is also an example using additional libraries into src/yourproject_with_lib. 
Have a look into build.xml, it contains some example inside on how to include external libraries, see comments.

In file build.properties are some pre-defined value for variable: CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and MAIN_FLAGS.
You can overwrite them in your local file local.properties.

TODO 
- add build with Makefile too
