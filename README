Arduino Developing Base Project

I've started this project in order to be able to easily start develop and test arduino application in eclipse.


USEFUL LINKS

DEPENDENCIES
* Linux: 
    - avr: I really suggest to download the avr toolchain from www.atmel.com.
           I've tried to create a correct toolchain with crossdev on Gentoo but any trying was resulting in a non working environment.
           (the toolchain was successfully created but the result hex was simply not working after installed on device, only easy code was) 
           
           Here the link to my working toolchain:
            http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=17311&category_id=163&family_id=607&subfamily_id=1965
            
    - avrdude
    
* windows:
    - avr: simply install winavr, it contains all you needs :
           http://winavr.sourceforge.net/
           
           
           
           
HOW TO USE    

There is an example under src/yourproject.
Copy files build.xml and local-sample.properties in your project dir.
Rename local-sample.properties in local.properties and adjust properties values in it.
Adjust also build.xml, it contains some example inside how to include external libraries



TODO 
- add build with Makefile too
- docs
