Arduino Developing Base Project

I've started this project in order to be able to easily start develop and deploy arduino application in eclipse.
You don't need any additional plugin, all you need is ANT and, optional, "Eclipse for C/C++ Developers" (if you want syntax highlighting).


USEFUL LINKS

http://arduino.cc/
http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/index.html


DEPENDENCIES
Arduino contains all you need: avr and avrdude
           
HOW TO USE    

There is an example under src/yourproject.
Copy files build.xml and local-sample.properties in your project dir.
Rename local-sample.properties in local.properties and adjust properties values in it.

There is also an example using additional libraries into src/yourproject_with_lib. 
Have a look into build.xml, it contains some comments over the necessary ant tasks to include external libraries.

In file include-build.xml are some pre-defined value for variable: CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and MAIN_FLAGS.
You can overwrite them in your local file local.properties.

TODO 
- add build with Makefile too
