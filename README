Arduino Developing Base Project


DEPENDENCIES
* Linux: 
    - avr: I really suggest to download the avr toolchain from www.atmel.com.
           I've tried to create a correct toolchain with crossdev on Gentoo but any trying was resulting in a non working environment.
           (the toolchain was successfully created but the result hex was simply not working after installed on device, only easy code was) 
           
           Here the link to my working toolchain:
            http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=17311&category_id=163&family_id=607&subfamily_id=1965
            
    - avrdude
    
* windows:
    - avr: simply install winavr, it contains all you needs :
           http://winavr.sourceforge.net/
           
           
           
           
HOW TO USE    

there is an example under src/yourproject.
